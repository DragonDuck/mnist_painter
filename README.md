# mnist_painter
Django app that takes user input on a canvas and classifies it as a digit according to a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset

This app is available live at [MNIST Painter](https://mnistpainter.herokuapp.com) (hosted on the free Heroku plan, so some patience for loading times is needed)
